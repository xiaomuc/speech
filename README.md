# Readme
I build this form only for iOS/iPadOS voice input use. I never test other os or other voice input functions.
To help communicate with somebody who has hearing difficulties.
Push the microphone button and speak. Text what you spoke will appear on the textbox.
The voice input turns off when:
* About 1 minute no input  
* put it off manually  
30 seconds later, the text will be erased automatically.
